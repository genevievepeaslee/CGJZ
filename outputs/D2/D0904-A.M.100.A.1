A security guard arrested after police investigating race riots found weapons in his Sydney home appeared in court Tuesday, where a prosecutor said he had links to white supremacists.
Race riots that led to the overthrow of this city's government in 1898 was actually an insurrection that white supremacists had planned for months to strip black residents of their rights, a state commission concluded.
A heavy weekend police presence at beaches in southern Sydney prevented a repeat of racial violence that rocked this city a week ago and headed off "potential disasters," a senior officer said Monday.
