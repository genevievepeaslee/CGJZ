The Palestine Liberation Organisation's top body is to meet at 8:00 am (0600 GMT) to discuss arrangements for a smooth transition of power following Yasser Arafat's death, a top official said Thursday.
The Palestinian Authority has declared a 40-day period of mourning across the Palestinian territories to mark the death of veteran leader Yasser Arafat, the head of his office said Thursday.
