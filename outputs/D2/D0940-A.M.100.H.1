Disney says "well over" 1 million people have visited Hong Kong Disneyland, finally relenting in releasing visitor figures amid speculation of disappointing attendance and criticism that the park _ mostly owned by the local government _ wasn't transparent enough.
Hong Kong Disneyland Tuesday dismissed  a report that the two-month-old theme park is suffering from poor  attendence and has failed to attract the number of visitors expected  by the local government.
Attendance at Hong Kong Disneyland is running below government forecasts two months after the park opened, the South China Morning Post reported Monday.
