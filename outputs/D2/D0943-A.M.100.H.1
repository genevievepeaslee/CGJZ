Venomous demands for justice  besieged Canada's government Thursday, after two Sikhs were cleared  of killing 329 people in a 1985 Air India jet bombing.
A Canadian judge acquitted two Indian-born Sikhs of killing 331 people two decades ago in the bombings of an Air India plane over the Atlantic and a Tokyo airport.
The verdict in the Air India bombing  trial in Canada, is unfair but has come too late to matter, some  relatives in India of victims of the 1985 bombing said Thursday.
