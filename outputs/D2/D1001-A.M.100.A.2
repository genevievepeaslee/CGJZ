In the poem ``Hug O' War'' from ``Where the Sidewalk Ends,''   Silverstein describes his favorite game:  


``I'd rather play at hug o' war,   


Where everyone hugs   


Instead of tugs,   


Where everyone giggles   


And rolls on the rug,   


Where everyone kisses,   


And everyone grins,   


And everyone cuddles,   


And everyone wins.''
``So   rather than doing a transplant like you would for leukemia, where  you completely wipe out the patient's own bone marrow and replace  it, in this case we want a mixture of the patient's own bone marrow  plus the donor marrow.''
