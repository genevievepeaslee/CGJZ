The three-count indictment _ two for second-degree murder, one for reckless endangerment _ applied to all four of the white officers who fired 41 bullets at African immigrant Amadou Diallo in the wee hours of Feb. 4, as he stood, unarmed, in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building.
Rather, he need only show that they shot Diallo ``with intent to cause'' Diallo's death, acted with ``a depraved indifference to human life,'' and ``did recklessly engage in conduct which created a grave risk of death.''
