"In terms of bio-diversity protection, Qinling and Sichuan  pandas need equal protection, but it is a more urgent task to rescue  and protect Qinling pandas due to their smaller number," Wang  Wanyun, chief of the Wild Animals Protection section of the Shaanxi  Provincial Forestry Bureau, told Xinhua.
The Wolong Giant Panda Nature  Reserve in southwest China's Sichuan Province has been fully  covered by a regional telecom network based on Intel's Centrino  mobile technology, said Wu Haishan, PR manager of Intel's Chengdu  business office.
