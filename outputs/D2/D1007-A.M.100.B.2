JAKARTA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) will hold a meeting on February 10-12 to discuss an emergency action plan to handle any possible "hindrance" against the upcoming general assembly of People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), the ABRI chief said Monday.
Saddened by the reports of firecrackers injuries and stray bullets wounds and deaths, Health Secretary Carmencita N. Reodica Friday strongly called on Filipinos to use noise-making devices, instead of firecrackers and the indiscriminate firing of guns.
