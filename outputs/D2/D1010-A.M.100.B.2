In an interview in the Bulgarian newspaper Troud, the director of Bulgaria's laboratory for detecting mad cow, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), Raiko Pechev said the Dutch test was "more precise, more rapid" than tests already approved by the EU and "is in its last stage of EU pre-certification trials".
People eating animal meat products contaminated with mad cow  disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), can develop a  human variant of the fatal brain-wasting disease, called  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
