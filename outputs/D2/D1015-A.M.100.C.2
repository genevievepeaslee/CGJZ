``Monkeys and elephants aren't as good as moving across gaps in the forest,'' said Smith, ``so hornbills likely provide a crucial first step in forest regeneration, particularly in regions that have been cleared.''
``The survival of the rain forest appears to rely to a large degree on the hornbills' ability to disperse seeds of so many species,'' said Thomas Smith, an associate professor of biology at San Francisco State and an author of two scientific papers on the Cameroon study.
