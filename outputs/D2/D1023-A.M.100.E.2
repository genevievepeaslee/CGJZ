``It's a way to bring in a popular witness for the defense and a   potential character witness, but once they put Hubbell's character  into evidence, he does get opened up and he's got a lot of  baggage,'' said St. John's University law professor John Barrett.
A part-owner of the Castle Grande development, Hubbell's   father-in-law, Seth Ward, collected $300,000 from McDougal's S&AMP;L.  The billing records identify 15 conversations between Mrs. Clinton  and Ward, but both say they don't remember them.
