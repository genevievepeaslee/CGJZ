On Sunday, about 3,000 people, mostly women and children of local Bugti tribesmen, left Dera Bugti, a day after 3,000 government employees and their families, fearing more fighting in the town, located some 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of Quetta, Baluchistan's provincial capital.
Paramilitary troops and tribal rebels have been locked in a  standoff in the town of Dera Bugti, near Sui, since a violent clash  on March 17 left dozens of civilians and eight troops dead.
