With underground electrical wiring becoming a general trend in recent years, Taipower has donated many waste cement utility poles for the creation of more than 10,000 artificial reefs in 79 coastal regions, including Taoyuan County's Yungan, Hsinchun County's Nanliao, Taichung County's Wuchi, Changhua County's Wangkung and Hualien County's Yenliao, for conservation of fishery resources and other marine life.
In the Phi Phi island area, Pai island and the western side of Phi Phi Don island's Ton Sai beach saw coral reefs overturned, broken or strewn with garbage.
