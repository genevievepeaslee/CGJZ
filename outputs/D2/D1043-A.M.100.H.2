Syrian President Bashar Assad condemned the assassination as "a horrible criminal action" and offered his country's condolences and support to Hariri's family and Lebanon at large.
"We hold the Lebanese authority and the Syrian authority, being the authority of tutelage in Lebanon, responsible for this crime and other similar crimes," said a statement after an opposition meeting held Monday night at the late leader's house in Beirut.
